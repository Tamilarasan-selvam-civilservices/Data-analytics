# 🚀 Intern Performance Intelligence System (v2.1)

---

## 🧠 1. Problem Statement

In most organizations, intern evaluation is often:

- Subjective  
- Based on limited metrics (attendance, basic scores)  
- Lacking consistency and transparency  

👉 This leads to challenges in:

- Identifying true top performers  
- Making fair hiring decisions  
- Measuring real contribution and productivity  

---

## 💡 2. Solution Approach

This project introduces a data-driven intern evaluation system that converts raw intern activity into actionable performance intelligence.

### The system:

- Uses multi-dimensional performance metrics  
- Applies a weighted KPI scoring model  
- Generates analytical insights via EDA  
- Provides an interactive dashboard for visualization and decision-making  

👉 **Goal:** Make intern evaluation objective, scalable, and business-ready.

## 🟡 7. KPI & Evaluation Model

### Metrics Table

| Dimension        | Metric |
|-----------------|--------|
| Productivity     | Completion Rate |
| Consistency      | Attendance (%) |
| Quality          | Quality Score |
| Time Discipline  | Deadline Adherence |
| Efficiency       | Duration Efficiency |
| Contribution     | Projects Completed |
| Behavior         | Obedience Score |

---

### Priority Score Formula

Priority Score =
- Completion Rate (20%)  
- Attendance (20%)  
- Quality Score (20%)  
- Before Deadline Completion (20%)  
- Projects Completed (weighted)  
- Duration Efficiency (10%)  
- Obedience Score (10%)
